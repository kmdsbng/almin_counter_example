directly assign to state instead of using `Store#setState`\n *\n * ## Read phase\n *\n * StoreGroup read the state from each stores.\n *\n * It means that call each `Store#getState()`.\n *\n * ### When\n *\n * - Initialize StoreGroup\n * - A parts of life-cycle during execute UseCase\n * - Force update StoreGroup\n * - Some store call `Store#emitChange`\n *\n * ### What does store?\n *\n * - Store return own state\n *\n * ### What does not store?\n *\n * - Does not update own state\n * - Please update own state in write phase\n *\n * ### Notes\n *\n * #### Pull-based: Recompute every time
